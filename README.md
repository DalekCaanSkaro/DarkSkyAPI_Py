# DarkSkyAPI_Py
This is sample code for calling the Dark Sky API for weather updates. Currently, this calles the Dark Sky API with a secret key appended to the API URL with the latitude and longitude coordinates as parameters. The printed results are pretty raw right now printing hourly and daily information to the terminal screen. 

# Objective
This is an ongoing project that allows me to learn the nuances of python and data analysis/science. More specifically, API calls to a API endpoint and managing JSON data using python. Feel free to add your thoughts as I am trying to learn Python.

# Directions 
Run the Dark_Sky_API_Call.py script as such: python3 Dark_Sky_API_Call.py
To change the locaiton used, change the latitude and longitude parameters in the URL variable at the top of the Dark_Sky_API_Call.py script. (url = "https://api.darksky.net/forecast/(Add Web Key Here)/(latitude),(longitude)") The default location is Philadelphia for reference.
You can sign up for a Dark Sky Secret Key here: https://darksky.net/dev The first 1,000 calls are free everyday.
